# GNU WEEBS PASSWORD MANAGER
## What is this?
This is password manager based on symmetric encryption where your password will be encrypted as cipher text and you can only unlock it with passkey you generate. There is much thing i should considered and investigate for this project. If you have an idea or found a problem with this project, feel free to open issue or contact me

## Why I Build this project?
Usually we use third-party password manager like 1password or Bitwarden right? But there is 1 problem with that. That's online service, which is we 100% rely on them whatever happened with our data. Yeah i know they had enough backup and using strong encryption to secure our data, but i'm more talking about their usage policy. For example, i once used a popular password manager but they suddenly change the rules said that their app can only be used for one of type client, so you can't have open your 1password on different device. I migrated from that password manager to other, but after sometimes the new password manager apply same rules with my previous password manager. So why not i build my own password manager where i can store my cipher wherever i want and import it with easily as long i remember the secret?
